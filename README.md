# Simple NLP Model Example

This example includes basic scripts for an NLP model creation. 

1. **preprocess.py**: Text data preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming).
2. **model.py**: A simple neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras.
3. **train.py**: A script where you should implement loading data, preprocessing, and training processes.
4. **evaluate.py**: A script to evaluate the trained model (to be implemented).
5. **predict.py**: A script to make predictions using the trained model (to be implemented).
6. **data_sample.txt**: A sample text data file.

## Usage

- Complete the `train.py`, `evaluate.py`, and `predict.py` scripts as per your use case and data.
- Utilize `preprocess.py` and `model.py` as modules in your training, evaluation, and prediction scripts.
- Replace `data_sample.txt` with your actual text data for model training and testing.

## Note

Ensure to install necessary Python libraries:
```bash
pip install nltk tensorflow
```
